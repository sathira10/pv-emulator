# Photovoltaic Emulator Frontend

This repository hosts the frontend for a Photovoltaic Emulator device, which was designed as part of the final year undergraduate project at the University of Moratuwa.

The device can emulate any solar PV module up to a maximum power of 400W, taking into account temperature and irradiance conditions. The user interface (this repository) allows the input of module parameters and environmental conditions. The device is also integrated with a Grafana dashboard for real time monitoring.

The frontend was migrated from `create-react-app` and the deprecated `material-ui` to using `Next.js` and `MUI` in 2023.
