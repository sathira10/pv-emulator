# Photovoltaic Emulator Frontend

This repository hosts the user interface for a Photovoltaic Emulator hardware device, which was designed as part of the final year undergraduate project at the University of Moratuwa.

The hardware device can emulate any solar PV module up to a maximum power of 400W, taking into account temperature and irradiance conditions. The user interface (this repository) allows the input of module parameters and environmental conditions. It is also integrated with a `grafana` dashboard for real time monitoring.

The frontend was migrated from `create-react-app` and the deprecated `material-ui` to using `Next.js` and `MUI` in 2023.
